/// \brief Turn the frontend's stateless GGUF model into an OpenVINO stateful one.
///
<<<<<<< HEAD
/// The GGUF frontend is universal: it always converts to a STATELESS graph, in which every KV cache
/// is an explicit model Parameter written by an ov::frontend::gguf::SetRows placeholder and read
/// back as a Result. That mirrors how optimum-intel exports (a stateless model plus a caller-side
/// `apply_make_stateful_transformation`), and it is what keeps statefulness out of the decoder
/// interface: a decoder describes ggml operations, not a deployment mode.
///
/// Statefulness is therefore a CALLER concern. Register this pass as a
/// ov::frontend::DecoderTransformationExtension before conversion:
///
///     ov::frontend::gguf::FrontEnd fe;
///     fe.add_extension(std::make_shared<ov::frontend::DecoderTransformationExtension>(
///         ov::frontend::gguf::pass::MakeStateful()));
///     auto model = fe.convert(fe.load(decoder_or_gguf_path));
///
/// or, when going through ov::Core (which forwards its extensions to the frontend before load):
///
///     core.add_extension(std::make_shared<ov::frontend::DecoderTransformationExtension>(
///         ov::frontend::gguf::pass::MakeStateful()));
///     auto model = core.read_model("model.gguf");
///
/// Extensions run in the frontend's normalization stage AHEAD of the built-in
/// LowerSetRowsStateless, so this pass consumes the KV-cache SetRows ops and the default stateless
/// lowering only ever sees the ones left over (e.g. MoE routing writes, which stay stateless).
///
/// Per KV cache it replaces the Parameter/Result pair with a Variable + ReadValue(empty init) +
/// Gather(beam_idx) + Concat(past, this step's rows) + Assign. Only a SetRows whose destination is a
/// model Parameter is converted; everything else is untouched.
///
/// The `beam_idx` input is ADDED by this pass, not expected from the decoder. It is a beam-search
/// index into an OpenVINO state -- ggml has no counterpart -- so declaring it in a decoder would put
/// a consumer-less input on the stateless graph and make two decoders of the same model disagree on
/// their IO. Creating it here keeps it next to its only consumer, the Gather above.
///
/// The empty ReadValue init is deliberate and required, not cosmetic: CPU's stateful_sdpa_fusion
/// folds the cache into ScaledDotProductAttentionWithKVCache, whose MemoryInputSDPA aborts on a
/// MemoryInput with zero parent edges. genai / optimum build the cache the same way.
///
/// SCOPE. This pass does the one part that is common to every stateless GGUF graph: growing the
/// cache. It deliberately does NOT touch the attention mask. A graph whose mask Parameter is
/// dynamically sized (what the native .gguf builder emits) needs no mask change at all -- the
/// caller simply feeds a mask as wide as the grown cache. A graph that preallocates a fixed mask
/// window instead reads it through a slice sized for that window, and the caller must re-slice it
/// to (query_len, past + query_len); the llama.cpp backend does exactly that in its own extension.
